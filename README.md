### Dependencies and Languages
The following are needed to run this project:
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Pandas
- AngularJS
- Bootstrap 5
- HTML 5, CSS 3, Javascript 
- PySolr(also an active local Apache Solr instance as well)

### What is this Project About?
Quite simply, the project is an exercise on IR(information retrieval). There are two parts to this project: 
<ul type="a">
    <li> Web searching that uses a google API </li>
    <li> Searching through a csv file that contains music records  </li>
</ul>

The user will be offered a graphical user interface that will allow them to switch between searching through music on the local csv file or to perform web searching. 

##### Note: The server that was initialized for this code was shut down by me due to not wanting to spend money on random search queries from others from the use of api keys. This can be easily remedied, however.
